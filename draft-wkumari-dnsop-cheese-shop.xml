    <abstract>
      <t>This document cuts down on junk queries to the DNS root and improves
      performance by answering queries locally from compliant resolvers. It
      does this by actually believing the NSEC responses.</t>

      not, it provides useful context ]</t>

      <t>The title of this draft (draft-wkumari-dnsop-cheese-shop) comes from
      a famous Monty Python skit - "The Cheese Shop". Knowledge of the skit is
      mandatory background knowledge for this document...</t>

    <section title="Believing NSEC records.">
      <t>This is a simply a refinement of <xref
      target="I-D.fujiwara-dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse"/>, for a limited use
      case. Fiull credit to the authors of the aforementioned draft, and this
      draft does not replace that draft, nor remove the need for the broader
      consideration of the use of NSEC records as described in <xref
      target="I-D.fujiwara-dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse"/>.</t>

      <t>The scope of this document is addressed specifically to recursive
      validating resolvers when querying the root zone. </t>

      <t>If the (DNSSEC validated) answer to a query to a root server is an
      NXDOMAIN then the resolver SHOULD cache the NSEC record provided in the
      response. The resolver should NOT send further queries for names within
      the range of the NSEC record for the lifetime of the cached NSEC TTL.
      Instead, the resolver SHOULD answer these queries directly with NXDOMAIN
      (and NSEC records if so signalled by EDNS). They SHOULD set the AA bit
      and AD bits.</t>
